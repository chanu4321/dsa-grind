# DSA Grind 🚀🤙
# Description:
Welcome to my **DSA Grind** repository! 🚀
This repository is my daily journal of solved LeetCode and DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) questions. As I prepare for my placements three years down the line, I've committed to consistent and deliberate practice to hone my problem-solving skills.
# What's Inside:
**LeetCode Solutions**: Daily solutions to the LeetCode problems i solve daily.
**Data Structures**: Implementation and optimization of key data structures.
**Algorithms**: Implementations of various algorithms.
# Why "dsa-grind"?
This repository serves as a testament to my commitment to continuous improvement. It's not just about solving problems; it's about understanding the underlying principles, optimizing solutions, and building a strong foundation for the challenges that lie ahead.
# How to Navigate:
Explore the "LeetCode" folder for categorized solutions, by using the name of the problem or the problem number of the question that you are looking for.
# Why Open Source?
By making my progress public, I hope to contribute to the learning community and receive feedback from fellow enthusiasts. Feel free to open issues, suggest improvements, or just drop by to say hello!
